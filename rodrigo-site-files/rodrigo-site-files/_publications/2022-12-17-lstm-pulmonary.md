## Abstract

This paper presents an LSTM-based deep learning model for forecasting pulmonary air leak recovery in patients with chest tubes. The model predicts lung recovery up to 8 hours in advance, enabling clinicians to make timely decisions about ventilator removal and patient care.

## Key Contributions

- Designed and implemented an LSTM architecture for medical time-series forecasting
- Achieved prediction windows of up to 8 hours ahead with high accuracy
- Provided actionable insights for clinical decision-making in chest tube management

## Clinical Impact

This work directly supports medical professionals by providing early warning signals for patient recovery, potentially reducing unnecessary ventilator time and improving patient outcomes.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- LSTM Neural Networks
- Medical Signal Processing
