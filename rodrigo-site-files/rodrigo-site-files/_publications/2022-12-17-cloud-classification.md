## Abstract

This paper addresses the challenge of classifying multi-layer cloud formations using satellite imagery from NASA's Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) and CloudSat/CALIPSO instruments. We tackle the inherent class imbalance problem in atmospheric science data using advanced machine learning techniques.

## Key Contributions

- Developed scalable pipelines for processing NASA satellite imagery
- Improved cloud classification accuracy by 20% through novel class balancing techniques
- Enhanced weather forecasting model inputs through better cloud layer identification

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Apache Spark
- SQL
- Linux
- Satellite Image Processing
