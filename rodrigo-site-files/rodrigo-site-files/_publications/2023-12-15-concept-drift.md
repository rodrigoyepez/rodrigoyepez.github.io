## Abstract

This paper presents a distributed approach to concept drift detection for efficient model adaptation in big data streaming environments. As data distributions change over time, machine learning models can become outdated and require retraining. Our method enables real-time detection of these distribution shifts across distributed computing environments.

## Key Contributions

- Developed a scalable concept drift detection algorithm for distributed systems
- Implemented efficient model adaptation strategies for streaming data
- Demonstrated improved performance on large-scale big data benchmarks

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Apache Spark
- TensorFlow
- Distributed Computing
