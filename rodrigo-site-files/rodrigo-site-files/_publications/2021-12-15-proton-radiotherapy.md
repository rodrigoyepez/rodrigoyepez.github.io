## Abstract

This paper investigates optimal hyperparameter configurations for deep fully connected neural networks applied to image reconstruction in proton radiotherapy. Through systematic hyperparameter search, we identify configurations that reduce model parameters by 30% while maintaining reconstruction accuracy.

## Key Contributions

- Conducted extensive hyperparameter optimization for compact neural networks
- Reduced model parameters by 30% without sacrificing accuracy
- Applied findings to improve proton radiotherapy image reconstruction

## Clinical Relevance

Improved image reconstruction in proton radiotherapy enables more precise tumor targeting, potentially reducing radiation exposure to healthy tissue and improving treatment outcomes for cancer patients.

## Technologies Used

- C
- Python
- Linux
- High-Performance Computing (HPC)
- Neural Network Optimization
