I am a **Machine Learning Engineer and Data Scientist** with hands-on experience applying deep learning to healthcare, biomedical, and scientific datasets. Currently, I work at UMBC's Division of Information Technology, where I build real-time transcription and visualization pipelines using Linux, SQL, Python, LLMs, and cloud infrastructure.

I've built multimodal AI systems, large-scale SQL and PySpark pipelines, and HPC-trained models for dementia analytics, pulmonary forecasting, AI cancer classification, and proton radiotherapy image enhancement. I am proficient in Python, NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, and PyTorch, with extensive experience developing end-to-end analytics and ML workflows.
