I design and build scalable data systems and production-grade analytics and machine learning pipelines.

I am a Computer Science Engineer (M.S.) with hands-on experience in software engineering, data infrastructure, and applied machine learning. My work focuses on building robust, scalable, and reproducible systems that transform raw data into reliable analytics and deployed models.

## What I Build

- Data pipelines and large-scale database systems (10TB+)
- Analytics and modeling workflows for structured and unstructured data
- Production machine learning pipelines with monitoring and retraining
- Real-time processing, visualization, and alerting systems
- Reproducible, maintainable software for data-driven decision making
