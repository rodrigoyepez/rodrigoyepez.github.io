## Overview

Developed a multimodal AI system that integrates audio and text data through advanced feature extraction techniques to improve dementia classification accuracy. This project was conducted as part of my graduate research at UMBC's College of Engineering and Technology.

## Technical Approach

### Audio Processing
- Extracted acoustic features from patient speech recordings
- Analyzed speech patterns, pauses, and vocal characteristics

### Text Analysis
- Applied NLP techniques to transcribed conversations
- Extracted semantic and syntactic features

### Feature Fusion
- Combined modalities using deep learning architectures
- Custom neural network for multimodal classification

## Key Results

- Improved classification accuracy through multimodal integration
- Demonstrated the value of combining audio and text signals for cognitive assessment
- Created reproducible pipelines for future research applications

## Technologies

`Python` `PyTorch` `Audio Processing` `NLP` `Deep Learning` `Feature Extraction`
