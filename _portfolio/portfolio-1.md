We propose a distributed drift detection workflow based on the DDM algorithm paired with a predictive model, implemented in Apache Spark. The workflow updates predictive models as drifts are detected, leveraging Pandas UDFs for efficient distribution across multiple worker nodes. Experiments on real-world datasets show positive results in Speedup, Scaleup, and detection delay.
